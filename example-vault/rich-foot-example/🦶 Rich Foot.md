2. Navigate to Community Plugins and disable Safe Mode
3. Click on Browse and search for "Rich Foot"
4. Install the plugin and enable it

## Usage

Once installed and enabled, Rich Foot will automatically add the following to the footer of your notes:

- Backlinks: Displayed as tags with links to the referencing notes
- Created Date: Shows when the note was first created
- Modified Date: Shows when the note was last modified

## Customization

Rich Foot allows you to customize its behavior by excluding certain folders from generating backlinks. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining a clean and relevant set of backlinks in your notes.

### Excluding Folders

To exclude folders from backlink generation:

1. Go to Obsidian Settings
2. Navigate to the Rich Foot plugin settings
3. In the "Excluded Folders" section, add the paths of the folders you want to exclude
4. Separate multiple folder paths by new lines

For example, if you want to exclude backlinks from your "Archive" and "Templates" folders, you would add:

```
Archive
Templates
```

This will ensure that backlinks are not generated for notes within these folders, keeping your backlink list clean and focused on relevant content.
