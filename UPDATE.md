## 📆 Dates Your Way

### v1.7.1
#### 🐛 Fixed
- Note embeds in canvas now have the correct height

### v1.7.0
#### ✨ Added
- `Custom Created/Modified Date Property` fields to allow users to specify their own frontmatter properties for dates, useful when file system dates are affected by sync processes and you track them separately.
