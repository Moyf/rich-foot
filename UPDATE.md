## 📆 Dates Your Way

### v1.7.2
#### 🐛 Fixed
- Date not formatted correctly if timestamp was included in the Custom Created/Modified Date Property

### v1.7.1
#### 🐛 Fixed
- Note embeds in canvas now have the correct height
- Duplicate "show dates" option in settings

#### ✨ Added
- If using custom created/modified date properties, the date now displays in the format of "Month Day, Year" if in proper date format, otherwise it displays the raw frontmatter filed string value.

### v1.7.0
#### ✨ Added
- `Custom Created/Modified Date Property` fields to allow users to specify their own frontmatter properties for dates, useful when file system dates are affected by sync processes and you track them separately.
